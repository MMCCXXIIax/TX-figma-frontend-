# 🔧 Build Fix - Terser to ESBuild

## ❌ Issue

**Error during Render deployment:**
```
[vite:terser] terser not found. Since Vite v3, terser has become an optional dependency. You need to install it.
```

**Cause:** 
- Vite config was set to use `minify: 'terser'`
- Since Vite v3, terser is an optional dependency (not included by default)
- Terser was not in `package.json` dependencies

---

## ✅ Solution

Changed minifier from `terser` to `esbuild` in `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
build: {
  target: 'esnext',
  outDir: 'dist',
  sourcemap: false,
  minify: 'esbuild', // Changed from 'terser' to 'esbuild'
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        vendor: ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-router-dom'],
        charts: ['recharts'],
        ui: ['@radix-ui/react-dialog', '@radix-ui/react-tabs'],
      },
    },
  },
},
```

## 🎯 Why ESBuild?

### **Advantages:**
1. ✅ **Built into Vite** - No extra dependencies needed
2. ✅ **Faster** - 10-100x faster than terser
3. ✅ **Good compression** - Only slightly larger output than terser
4. ✅ **Default in Vite** - Recommended by Vite team

### **Comparison:**

| Minifier | Speed | Compression | Dependencies |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **esbuild** | ⚡ Very Fast | 📦 Good | ✅ Built-in |
| terser | 🐌 Slow | 📦 Excellent | ❌ Optional |

## 📝 Alternative Solutions

If you ever need terser for better compression:

### **Option 1: Install Terser**
```bash
npm install -D terser
```

Then in `vite.config.ts`:
```typescript
build: {
  minify: 'terser',
  terserOptions: {
    compress: {
      drop_console: true, // Remove console.logs
    },
  },
}
```

### **Option 2: Keep ESBuild (Recommended)**
Current solution - no changes needed!
