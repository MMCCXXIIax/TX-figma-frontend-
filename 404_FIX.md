# 🔧 404 Error Fix - Render Deployment

## ❌ Problem

Getting 404 error when accessing: `https://tx-figma-frontend.onrender.com`

## 🔍 Root Causes

### **1. React Router Client-Side Routing**
- React Router handles routing on the client side
- Server doesn't know about routes like `/ai-insights`, `/charts`, etc.
- Server returns 404 for any route except `/`

### **2. Missing Redirect Rules**
- Need to redirect all routes to `index.html`
- Let React Router handle the routing

---

## ✅ Solutions Applied

### **1. Created `public/_redirects` File**

This file tells Render to redirect all routes to index.html:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

**What it does:**
- Catches all routes (`/*`)
- Serves `index.html` for every route
- Returns 200 status (not 404)
- React Router then handles the actual routing

### **2. Updated `render.yaml`**

Changed from Web Service to Static Site:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: tx-figma-frontend
    runtime: static  # Changed from 'node' to 'static'
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    staticPublishPath: ./dist  # Where the built files are
    routes:
      - type: rewrite
        source: /*
        destination: /index.html  # Redirect all routes to index.html
```

---

## 🚀 How to Fix in Render Dashboard

### **Option 1: Use the Updated Files (Recommended)**

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add public/_redirects render.yaml
   git commit -m "Fix: Add redirects for React Router and update render.yaml"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render will auto-deploy** with the new configuration

### **Option 2: Manual Configuration in Render**

If you created the service manually in Render dashboard:

1. Go to your service settings
2. **Change these settings:**
   - **Publish Directory:** `dist`
   - **Add Redirect Rule:**
     - Source: `/*`
     - Destination: `/index.html`
     - Action: `Rewrite`

3. **Redeploy** the service

## 🔧 Alternative: If Using Web Service

If you want to keep it as a Web Service (not Static Site):

### **Update render.yaml:**
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: tx-figma-frontend
    runtime: node
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    startCommand: npx serve -s dist -l $PORT
```

### **Install serve:**
Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "serve": "^14.2.0"
  }
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing After Fix

### **1. Wait for Deployment**
- Render will rebuild and deploy (5-10 minutes)
- Check Render logs for successful build

### **2. Test Routes**
Visit these URLs and verify they work:
- ✅ `https://tx-figma-frontend.onrender.com/`
- ✅ `https://tx-figma-frontend.onrender.com/ai-insights`
- ✅ `https://tx-figma-frontend.onrender.com/charts`
- ✅ `https://tx-figma-frontend.onrender.com/alerts`

### **3. Test Browser Refresh**
- Navigate to `/ai-insights`
- Press F5 to refresh
- Should NOT get 404

---

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### **Before Fix:**
```
GET /ai-insights → 404 Not Found
GET /charts → 404 Not Found
```

### **After Fix:**
```
GET /ai-insights → 200 OK (serves index.html)
GET /charts → 200 OK (serves index.html)
React Router → Renders correct component
```

## 🚨 Common Issues

### **Issue: Still getting 404 after deploy**
**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check Render logs for build errors
3. Verify `dist` folder contains `index.html`
4. Check Render dashboard settings

### **Issue: CSS/JS not loading**
**Solutions:**
1. Check `vite.config.ts` has `base: '/'`
2. Verify assets are in `dist/assets/` folder
3. Check browser console for errors

### **Issue: Environment variables not working**
**Solutions:**
1. Add env vars in Render dashboard
2. Prefix with `VITE_` (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE`)
3. Rebuild after adding env vars
